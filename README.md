# DevOps Practice Repository

Welcome to the DevOps Practice Repository! This repository is set up for learning and practicing DevOps concepts, tools, and workflows in a hands-on manner.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- Learn and practice foundational DevOps skills.
- Experiment with tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, and more.
- Build and deploy simple applications to understand automation and infrastructure as code.
- Collaborate effectively using version control and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. **Installed Tools**:
   - Git
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes (e.g., minikube or a cloud-based cluster)
   - Terraform
   - A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Vim)

2. **Accounts**:
   - A GitHub account for collaboration.
   - A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS) for advanced exercises.

2. **Follow the exercises**:
   Navigate to each folder (e.g., `terraform_handson`) and follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` file.

3. **Practice and Experiment**:
   Modify the provided examples, create your own configurations, and test them in your environment.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Version Control**: Learn Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaboration.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure.
- **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
